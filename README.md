## **ClearPolicy: Insurance Policy Simplification**

**Problem:**

Many insurance policyholders struggle to understand the complex jargon used in their documents, leading to confusion about their coverage entitlements.

**Why:**

Insurance documents are often filled with complex words and phrases that many people find hard to understand. This confusion can lead to frustration and uncertainty, as customers aren't sure about what their insurance covers. By making these documents easier to read, we can help customers feel more confident and satisfied. This not only improves their experience but also helps the company by reducing the number of questions and complaints they receive. In the bigger picture, clearer insurance documents make the entire industry more transparent and trustworthy.

**Success:**

The project's success will be measured by the reduction in the number of words in the policy documents and an improvement in the Flesch readability score. The goal is a significant decrease in document length with a corresponding increase in readability, making policies more accessible to the average user.

**Audience:**

This project is designed for everyday insurance customers who feel overwhelmed by the complicated language typically found in insurance policies. These customers might struggle to understand their coverage details, leading to frustration and a possible disconnect with their insurance provider. Our goal is to make insurance policies easier to read and understand, helping these customers feel more informed and secure about their insurance choices.

**Potential Solution:**

The solution involves several key technological approaches:

1. **Data Utilization:** The project will leverage existing insurance policies and a comprehensive insurance glossary as primary datasets.
2. **Model Fine-Tuning:** Embeddings will be fine-tuned on the insurance policy data to capture domain-specific nuances.
3. **LLM Fine-Tuning:** An open-source large language model (LLM) will be fine-tuned using synthetic data generated by GPT-4 based on the insurance glossary.
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The LlamaParse tool will parse the insurance policy data, integrating various retrieval strategies to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated summaries.
5. **Prompt Engineering:** This technique will be used to transform the complex policy text into a simplified, structured, and readable summary.

**Sharing:**

The results and methodology of this project will be shared within the AI bootcamp cohort and potentially at industry conferences focusing on AI applications in finance and insurance. Additionally, I plan to document and share the project on GitHub, Linked and Twitter, for more general audience appeal. Last but not least, I would love to share the project within my company.
