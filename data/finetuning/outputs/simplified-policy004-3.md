Who's covered?
This policy covers Bright Light Electrical Contractors.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 5/15/2016, and before 5/15/2017.

Against what?
We protect you against general liability claims, automobile liability, umbrella liability, excess liability, workers compensation, employers' liability, and leased/rented equipment claims. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- General Liability:
  - Each Occurrence: $2,000,000
  - Damage to Rented Premises (Each Occurrence): $200,000
- Automobile Liability:
  - Combined Single Limit (Each Accident): $2,000,000

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.
