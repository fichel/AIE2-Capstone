We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium amount per year, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers SofLite Inc.

When?
This policy covers events that started on November 15, 2023, and before November 15, 2024.

Against what?
We protect you against General Liability, Damage to Rented Premises, Medical Expenses, Personal & Advertising Injury, and more. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Each Occurrence: $1,000,000
- Damage to Rented Premises (Each Occurrence): $1,000,000
- Medical Expenses (Any one person): $10,000
- Personal & Advertising Injury: $1,000,000
- General Aggregate: $2,000,000
- Products - Comp/Op Agg: $2,000,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage is adequate for your business operations.

If $2,000,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.
