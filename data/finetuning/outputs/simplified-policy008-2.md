Congratulations! You got yourself a Commercial General Liability Policy for your JJ TRANSPORT LLC at 1234 E BROADWAY AVE STE B200, Houston, TX 77002. Your policy number is GTUL000999-02.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium amount per year, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers JJ TRANSPORT LLC.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 5/15/2022, and before 5/15/2023.

Against what?
We protect you against various perils. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- EACH OCCURRENCE: $1,500,000
- DAMAGE TO RENTED PREMISES (Each occurrence): $150,000
- MED EXP (Any one person): $7,500

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage limits are adequate for your needs.

If $3,000,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If any covered items are damaged, we will cover the cost of replacing them with new items of similar kind and quality.
