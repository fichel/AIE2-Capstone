We protect you against Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability, Uninsured Motorists Bodily Injury, Property Damage, Other Than Collision Loss, Collision Loss, Towing & Labor Costs, and Extended Transportation Expenses. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

If your vehicle is damaged, we will pay for the cost to repair or replace it with a new vehicle of the same make and model.
