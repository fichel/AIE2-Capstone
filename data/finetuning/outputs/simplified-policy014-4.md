Congratulations! You got yourself a Commercial General Liability Policy for your business at 225 S Broadway #115, Los Angeles, CA 90012. Your policy number is 705197025.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per [Premium Frequency], so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers M.J.P MEDIA PRODUCTIONS located at 8721 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90069.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 07/10/2015, and before 07/10/2016.

Against what?
We protect you against General Liability, Commercial General Liability - Occurrence Version, Contractual - Incidental Only, Personal & Advertising Injury, Each Occurrence, Fire Damage (Any one fire), and Medical Expense (Any one person).

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

General Aggregate - $2,000,000
Products-Comp/OPS Aggregate - $1,000,000
Personal & Advertising Injury - $1,000,000
Each Occurrence - $1,000,000
Fire Damage (Any one fire) - $150,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage limits are adequate for your needs.

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than [Per-Item Limit], be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If any covered items are damaged, we will provide coverage for the cost of replacing them with new items.
