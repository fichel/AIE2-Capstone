Against what?
We protect you against general liability claims and damages.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

If $1,500,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.
