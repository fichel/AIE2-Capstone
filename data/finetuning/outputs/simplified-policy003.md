Congratulations! You got yourself a Property Insurance Policy for your Village On The Green Hoa at 2500 Via Cabrillo Marina, San Pedro, CA 90731-7224. Your policy number is 92-QR-4650-9.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium amount per premium frequency, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers the property and common areas detailed within the Association bylaws, including fixtures, improvements, alterations, and appliances within a unit.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 06/18/2015, and before 06/18/2016.

Against what?
We protect you against named perils such as earthquake, wind, and flood. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Building: $11,483,600
- Blanket Pers Prop: [Limit not specified]

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage limits are adequate for your property.

If $11,483,600 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
This policy provides replacement cost coverage on described property and common areas detailed within the Association bylaws.
