Who's covered?
This policy covers Johnson & Johnson.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 04/01/2020, and before 04/01/2023.

Against what?
We protect you against various liabilities. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Each Occurrence: $15,000,000
- Damage to Rented Premises (Each occurrence): $1,500,000
- Personal & Adv Injury: $15,000,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage limits are adequate for your business operations.

If $15,000,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.
