We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per policy period, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Bella, the 10-week-old female French Bulldog puppy.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 10/20/21, and before 11/20/21.

Against what?
We protect you against bodily injury and property damage. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a bodily injury limit of $7000.00 and a property damage limit of $7000.00.

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage limits are adequate for your needs.

If $7000.00 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
We provide coverage for the replacement cost of any covered items.
