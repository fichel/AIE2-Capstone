Congratulations! You got yourself a Commercial General Liability Policy for your business at 8921 Sunset Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90069. Your policy number is 705297023.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per year, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers P.R.S MEDIA PRODUCTIONS.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 06/20/2015, and before 06/20/2016.

Against what?
We protect you against General Liability, Products-Comp/OPS Aggregate, Personal & Advertising Injury, Each Occurrence, Fire Damage (Any one fire), and Medical Expense (Any one person). There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

General Aggregate - $2,000,000
Products-Comp/OPS Aggregate - $700,000
Personal & Advertising Injury - $700,000
Each Occurrence - $700,000
Fire Damage (Any one fire) - $100,000
Medical Expense (Any one person) - $10,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage limits are adequate for your business operations.

If $2,000,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If any covered items are damaged, we will reimburse you for the cost of replacing them with new items.
