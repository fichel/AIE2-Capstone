We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per policy period, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Lucy (6 months old female Golden Retriever puppy).

Against what?
We protect you against bodily injury and property damage. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a bodily injury limit of $7000.00 and a property damage limit of $7000.00.
