Congratulations! You got yourself a Pet Liability Insurance Policy for your 12-week-old male Bernese Mountain puppy at Charlie. Your policy number is PTL01574.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per premium frequency, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Charlie.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 8/18/21, and before 9/18/21.

Against what?
We protect you against bodily injury and property damage. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

Bodily Injury Limits: $5000.00
Property Damage Limits: $5000.00

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage is adequate for your needs.

If $5000.00 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than [Per-Item Limit], be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If your pet is injured or causes damage, we will cover the cost of treatment or repairs up to the policy limits.
