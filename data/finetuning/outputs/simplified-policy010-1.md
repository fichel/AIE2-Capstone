Congratulations! You got yourself a Farmers Value Insurance Package Policy for your Automobile at 50 Main St, Hartford, CT 06106-1543. Your policy number is Policy 2.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your $2,325.40 per 6 months, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Covered Driver(s) Javier Sanchez.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 22/01/2024, and before 22/07/2024.

Against what?
We protect you against Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability, Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist, Comprehensive Deductible, Collision Deductible, Rental Reimbursement, and Glass Deductible Buyback. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily Injury Liability: $50,000 per person / $100,000 per accident
- Property Damage Liability: $50,000
- Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist: $50,000 per person / $100,000 per accident
- Comprehensive Deductible: $500
- Collision Deductible: $500
- Rental Reimbursement: $75
- Glass Deductible Buyback: Yes

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy if the coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything.

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
We provide coverage based on the replacement cost of your vehicle.
