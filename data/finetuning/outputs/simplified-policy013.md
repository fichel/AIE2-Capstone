Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your Personal Property at 665 Auburn Ave, Atlanta, GA 30312. Your policy number is PV936890T824.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your $218 ($18.17/mo) per year, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers AKSHMA SAINI's Personal Property.

When?
This policy covers events that started after June 14, 2023 08:01 PM, and before June 16, 2024 09:01 PM.

Against what?
We protect you against Covered Perils. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

|COVERAGE|MAXIMUM AMOUNT|COST|
|---|---|---|
|Personal Property|$40,000|Included|
|Loss Of Use|$12,000|Included|
|Personal Liability|$100,000|Included|
|Medical Payments To Others|$1,000|Included|
|Portable Electronics|$3,000|Included|
|$250 Deductible|Included| |

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage is adequate.

If $40,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. <And if you own any valuable items worth more than $3,000, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.>

Used or new?
If your Personal Property is damaged or stolen, we will reimburse you for the cost of a new item, without deducting for depreciation.
