We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium amount per [Premium Frequency], so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers the vehicle listed under the policy number.

This policy covers events that started after 04-20-20, and before 10-20-20.

Against what?
We protect you against Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability, Uninsured Motorists Bodily Injury, Property Damage, Other Than Collision Loss, Collision Loss, Towing & Labor Costs, and Extended Transportation Expenses. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than [Per-Item Limit], be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If your vehicle is damaged, we will pay for the cost to repair or replace it with a new vehicle of the same make and model, minus any applicable deductible.
