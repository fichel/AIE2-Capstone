Congratulations! You got yourself a Farmers Value Insurance Package Policy for your Automobile at 890 Elmwood Ave, Bridgeport, CT 06605-1912. Your policy number is Policy 2.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your $1,950.45 per 6 months, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Elijah Martinez.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 11/22/2023, and before <End Date>.

Against what?
We protect you against Bodily Injury, Property Damage, Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist, and more. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily Injury Liability: 30/60
- Property Damage Liability: 30
- Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist: 30/60
- Bodily Injury Comprehensive Deductible: $500
- Collision Deductible: $500

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage is adequate for your needs.

If $1,950.45 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. <And if you own any valuable items worth more than [Per-Item Limit], be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.>

Used or new?
If your vehicle is damaged, we will pay the cost to repair or replace it with a new one of similar make and model.
