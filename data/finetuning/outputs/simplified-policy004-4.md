We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium amount per policy period, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Spark & Son's Electrical Services.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 5/15/2016, and before 5/15/2017.

Against what?
We protect you against general liability claims and damages.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Each Occurrence: $1,500,000
- Damage to Rented Premises (Each Occurrence): $150,000
- Medical Expenses (Any one person): $7,500
- Personal & Advertising Injury: $1,500,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy coverage adequacy for hypothetical scenarios.

If $1,500,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.
