Congratulations! You got yourself a Commercial General Liability Policy for your Tesla, Inc. at 3500 Deer Creek Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304. Your policy number is TW123 456789.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per policy period, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Tesla, Inc. and Tesla Insurance Services.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 04/01/2020, and before 04/01/2023.

Against what?
We protect you against bodily injury, property damage, personal & adv injury, and more. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Each Occurrence: $15,000,000
- Damage to Rented Premises (Each occurrence): $1,500,000
- Personal & Adv Injury: $15,000,000
- General Aggregate: $15,000,000
- Products - Comp/Op Agg: $15,000,000
- Combined Single Limit (Each accident): $3,000,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the coverage limits are adequate.

If $15,000,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than [Per-Item Limit], be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If your property is damaged, we will cover the cost of replacing it with new property of similar kind and quality.
