We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per policy period, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Park Place Condominium Association.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 09/26/2016, and before 09/26/2017.

Against what?
We protect you against Earthquake, Wind, and Flood. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Building: $12,500,000
- Blanket Pers Prop: $
- Blanket Bldg & PP: $

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy coverage adequacy in case of an earthquake, wind, or flood.

If $12,500,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than [Per-Item Limit], be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If your building is damaged, we will cover the cost to repair or replace it with materials of like kind and quality without deduction for depreciation.
