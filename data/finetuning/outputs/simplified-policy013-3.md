Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your Personal Property at 1234 Peachtree St, Savannah, GA 31401. Your policy number is KG120589G678.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your $235 ($19.58/mo) per year, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers CHRISTOPHER WALKER's Personal Property.

When?
This policy covers events that started after August 22, 2023 03:01 PM, and before August 24, 2024 04:01 PM.

Against what?
We protect you against Covered Perils. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

|COVERAGE|MAXIMUM AMOUNT|
|---|---|
|Personal Property|$35,000|
|Loss Of Use|$15,000|
|Personal Liability|$120,000|
|Medical Payments To Others|$1,500|
|Portable Electronics|$2,500|
|$300 Deductible| |

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy if $35,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. <And if you own any valuable items worth more than $2,500, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.>
