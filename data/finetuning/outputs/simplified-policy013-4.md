Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your rented property at 1805 Piedmont Ave, Atlanta, GA 30324. Your policy number is PY739286T625.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your $260 ($21.67/mo) per year, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers Sanjay Kumar and his rented property.

When?
This policy covers events that started after July 10, 2023 09:30 AM, and before July 12, 2024 10:30 AM.

Against what?
We protect you against covered perils. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Personal Property: $50,000
- Loss Of Use: $15,000
- Personal Liability: $150,000
- Medical Payments To Others: $2,000
- Portable Electronics: $5,000
- $300 Deductible

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy if the coverage is adequate for your needs.

If $50,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than $5,000, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

Used or new?
If your personal property is damaged or stolen, we will reimburse you for the cost of a new item, not its depreciated value.
