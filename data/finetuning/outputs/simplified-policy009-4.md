Congratulations! You got yourself a Liability Insurance Policy for your business at The Hartford Business Service Center, 3600 Wiseman Blvd, San Antonio, TX 78251. Your policy number is 77 SBU BB6SW6.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium per year, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

Who's covered?
This policy covers BrightStar LLC.

When?
This policy covers events that started after 12/01/2023, and before 12/01/2024.

Against what?
We protect you against general liability, damage to rented premises, medical expenses, personal & advertising injury, products-completed operations aggregate, and more. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Each Occurrence: $1,500,000
- Damage to Rented Premises (Each Occurrence): $1,500,000
- Medical Expenses (Any one person): $15,000
- Personal & Advertising Injury: $1,500,000
- General Aggregate: $3,000,000
- Products-Completed Operations Aggregate: $3,000,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy coverage and make sure it aligns with your business needs.

If $3,000,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.
