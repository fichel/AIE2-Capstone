We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **3M Company**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after 03/01/2020, and before 03/01/2023 for the Commercial General Liability, and before 03/01/2021 for Workers Compensation.

## Against what?
We protect you against claims related to general liability and workers compensation. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy does not provide replacement cost coverage, it provides coverage on an actual cash value basis. This means if a covered loss occurs, you would be reimbursed for the cost of replacing the item, less any depreciation.
