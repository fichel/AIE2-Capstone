We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Ocean View Condominium Association**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after September 10, 2017, and before September 10, 2018.

## Against what?
We protect you against a number of perils including Earthquake, Wind, Flood, Inland Marine, and Crime. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Earthquake Damage: $15,000,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. If a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, were to occur, would your coverage be sufficient?

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.
