## Against what?
We protect you against damages usual to your operations and claims related to employment practices. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

## Used or new?
This policy offers coverage primarily on an occurrence basis. This means that we cover the claims that occur during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is reported. As long as the incident that gives rise to the claim happened during the policy period, the policy will respond.
