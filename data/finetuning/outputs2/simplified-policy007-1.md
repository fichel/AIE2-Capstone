## Against what?
We protect you against various risks associated with your business operations including general liability, garage liability, excess/umbrella liability, and workers' compensation among others. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of your coverage limits:

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy is based on the value of the items at the time of the loss, not the cost to replace them with new items. This means that depreciation will be taken into account when calculating any potential claims payout.
