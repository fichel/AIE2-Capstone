Congratulations! You got yourself a General Liability Policy for your Film Production business at 9852 Sunflower Ave, San Bernardino, CA 92404. Your policy number is **702345890**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **R.S.D Film Production**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after 10/09/2013, and before 10/09/2014.

## Against what?
We protect you against various perils including general aggregate, products-completed operations aggregate, personal & advertising injury, and more. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- General Aggregate - $1,500,000
- Products-Comp/OPS Aggregate - $750,000
- Personal & Advertising Injury - $600,000
- Each Occurrence - $600,000
- Fire Damage (Any one fire) - $100,000
- Medical Expense (Any one person) - $10,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and see if these limits would cover potential losses during a major production mishap.

If these policy limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy covers for the actual cost of the items at the time of loss, not the replacement cost.
