Congratulations! You got yourself a Pet Transportation and General Liability Policy for your 8-month-old female Golden Retriever puppy, Max, in New York. Your policy number is **PTL02085**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Max, your 8-month-old female Golden Retriever puppy**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after October 20, 2021, and before November 20, 2021.

## Against what?
We protect Max against potential injuries and damages that might occur during transportation. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily Injury Limits: $6000.00
- Property: $6000.00

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. Is $6000 enough to cover potential veterinary costs if Max gets injured during transportation? 

If $12000 total coverage isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
In case of an accident, we will consider the current market value of your insured property for reimbursement.
