We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers the Lake Shore Tower Condominium Association.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after 05/01/2010, and before 05/01/2011.

## Against what?
We protect you against general liability, automobile liability, excess/umbrella liability, and property damage. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- General Liability: $2,500,000
- Automobile Liability: $1,500,000
- Excess/Umbrella Liability: $30,000,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. If your property value or potential liability exceeds these limits, you might want to consider increasing your coverage. 

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy provides reimbursement for the replacement cost of covered items. That means if something is damaged or stolen, we'll pay the cost to repair or replace it with an item of similar kind and quality, minus your deductible.
