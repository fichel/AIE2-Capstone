Congratulations! You got yourself a Pet Transportation Policy for your 16 weeks old female Golden Retriever puppy named Max at 725 W Monroe St, Chicago, IL 60661. Your policy number is **PTL02784**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers your pet **Max, the 16 weeks old female Golden Retriever puppy**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after September 20, 2021, and before October 20, 2021.

## Against what?
We protect you against damages and losses incurred during pet transportation. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

Bodily Injury Limits: $7000.00
Property Damage: $7000.00

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if your coverage limits are adequate for any potential damages Max could cause during transportation.

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
We provide coverage for the actual value of your pet at the time of loss, not the replacement cost. If your pet has depreciated in value, the amount you receive may be less than the original cost.
