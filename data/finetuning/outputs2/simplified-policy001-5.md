Congratulations! You got yourself a Comprehensive Insurance Policy for your property at 1224 W Monroe Street, Springfield, IL 62704. Your policy number is **EI890175**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Cityscape Towers Condominium Association**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after 05/01/2009, and before 05/01/2010.

## Against what?
We protect you against general liability, automobile liability, excess/umbrella liability, boiler & machinery, crime, directors & officers liability, earthquake, and flood. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

General Liability: Each Occurrence - $1,200,000
Fire Damage: Any one fire - $350,000
Medical Expenses: Any one person - $15,000
Personal & Advertising Injury: $1,200,000
General Aggregate: $2,500,000
Products - Completed Operations Aggregate: $2,500,000
Automobile Liability: Combined Single Limit (Each Accident) - $1,200,000
Excess/Umbrella Liability: Each Occurrence & Aggregate - $30,000,000
Boiler & Machinery: $145,137,931 / $6,000 Deductible
Crime: $1,200,000 / $15,000 Deductible
Directors & Officers Liability: $2,500,000 / $6,000 Retention
Earthquake: $160,000,000/$110,000 Deductible
Flood: $110,000,000/$110,000 Deductible

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy, perhaps considering a hypothetical scenario like a major natural disaster.

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

## Used or new?
Your policy covers the replacement cost, which means if a covered loss occurs, we'll pay the cost to repair or replace the damaged property, up to your policy's limits, without factoring in depreciation.
