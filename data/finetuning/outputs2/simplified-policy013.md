Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your property at 665 Auburn Ave, Atlanta, GA 30312. Your policy number is **PV936890T824**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$218 per annum ($18.17/month)**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Akshma Saini**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after June 14, 2023 08:01 PM, and before June 16, 2024 09:01 PM.

## Against what?
We protect you against loss or damage to personal property, loss of use of the insured property, personal liability, and medical payments to others. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Personal Property: $40,000
- Loss Of Use: $12,000
- Personal Liability: $100,000
- Medical Payments To Others: $1,000
- Portable Electronics: $3,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. If a fire destroys all your belongings, would the total payout be enough to replace everything?

If the total coverage of $156,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than your individual coverage limits, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

## Used or new?
We provide Replacement Cost Coverage. This means if your belongings are damaged or stolen, we'll pay you the cost to replace them with new items of similar kind and quality, minus your deductible.
