## Who's covered?

## Against what?
We protect you against liabilities arising from your business operations. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

If these coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.
