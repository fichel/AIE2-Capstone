## Who's covered?
This policy covers **LT CARGO INC**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after May 11, 2022, and before May 11, 2023.

## Against what?
We protect you against liabilities from accidents, injuries, and damages that occur in the course of your business operations. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Each Occurrence: $1,500,000
- Damage to Rented Premises (Each Occurrence): $200,000
- Med Exp (Any One Person): $10,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. Consider a scenario where multiple accidents occur within a short period and evaluate if the aggregate limit is enough.

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
Your coverage offers a replacement cost, meaning it pays the cost to repair or replace the damaged property without deduction for depreciation.
