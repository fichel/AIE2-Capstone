This policy covers events that started after 09/26/2016, and before 09/26/2017.

## Against what?
We protect you against basic, broad and special causes of loss including earthquake, wind and flood. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.
