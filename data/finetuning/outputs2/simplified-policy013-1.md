Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your property at 123 Broadway, San Francisco, CA 94109. Your policy number is **PV837123B920**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$250 per year ($20.83/month)**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **James Harrison and his property**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after July 1, 2023, and before July 1, 2024.

## Against what?
We protect you against damages and losses to personal property, loss of use, personal liability, medical payments to others, and loss or damage to portable electronics. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Personal Property: $50,000
- Loss of Use: $15,000
- Personal Liability: $120,000
- Medical Payments to Others: $2,000
- Portable Electronics: $5,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. If $187,000 (the sum of all the above coverage limits) isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the individual limits above, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

## Used or new?
This policy provides replacement cost coverage, which means we will pay the cost to repair or replace your property with new items of like kind and quality, up to the coverage limits.
