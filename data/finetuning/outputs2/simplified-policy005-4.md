Congratulations! You got yourself a Pet Transportation Policy for your 6 months old female Golden Retriever puppy, Lucy, at Gilbert, AZ 85233. Your policy number is **PTL01824**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Lucy (6 months old female Golden Retriever puppy)**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after September 10, 2021, and before October 10, 2021.

## Against what?
We protect you against various accidents and issues that can occur during pet transportation. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily Injury Limits: $7000.00
- Property: $7000.00

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider whether this coverage would be enough if, for example, Lucy was injured during transportation and needed extensive veterinary care.

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. 

## Used or new?
We understand that pets are irreplaceable, but we promise to cover the financial expenses related to their health and well-being to the best of our abilities under the terms of this policy.
