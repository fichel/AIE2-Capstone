Congratulations! You got yourself an Auto Insurance Policy for your 2013 Lincoln Navigator at 21602 Grand Bay Ln Katy, TX 77449. Your policy number is **FRJVBZ**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **premium**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Nicholas Edwards** and his 2013 Lincoln Navigator.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after June 10, 2021, and before December 10, 2021.

## Against what?
We protect you against bodily injury, property damage, rental costs, personal injury, and uninsured/underinsured motorists. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily injury liability: $30,000 per person, $60,000 per accident
- Property damage liability: $25,000 per accident
- Rental: $50 per day, $1,500 per accident
- Personal injury protection: $5,000 per person
- Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $30,000 per person, $60,000 per accident
- Uninsured motorist property damage: $25,000 per accident
- Comprehensive: Up to actual cash value, $1,000 deductible
- Collision: Up to actual cash value, $1,000 deductible

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check if your coverage is adequate in the event of an accident where you're found at fault and damages exceed your coverage limits.

## Used or new?
Your policy provides actual cash value coverage. In the event of a covered loss, we will pay the cost to repair your vehicle, less your chosen deductible, up to your vehicle's actual cash value. The actual cash value is the market value of your vehicle just before the loss occurred, including deductions for wear and tear, age, and other factors.
