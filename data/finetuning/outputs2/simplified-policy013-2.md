Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your property at 1230 Peachtree St, Atlanta, GA 30309. Your policy number is **PX748209T129**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$250 per year ($20.83 per month)**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Ryan Stevenson and his property**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after August 20, 2023 10:30 AM, and before August 22, 2024 11:30 AM.

## Against what?
We protect you against unforeseen losses or damages to your property. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Personal Property: $50,000
- Loss Of Use: $15,000
- Personal Liability: $120,000
- Medical Payments To Others: $2,000
- Portable Electronics: $5,000
- Deductible: $300

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider whether this coverage would be sufficient if, for example, a major fire or flood caused you to lose all of your personal property.

If these coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

## Used or new?
If you experience a loss, we'll pay the cost to replace your items with new ones of similar kind and quality, minus your deductible. This is known as replacement cost coverage.
