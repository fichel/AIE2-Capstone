Congratulations! You got yourself an Auto Insurance Policy for your 2018 Toyota Highlander at 345 Maple St Houston, TX 77002. Your policy number is **KLMFAZ**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your various premiums detailed below, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Samantha Green**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after July 15, 2021, and before January 15, 2022.

## Against what?
We protect you against bodily injuries, property damage, rental costs, personal injuries, uninsured/underinsured motorists, and provide roadside assistance. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily injury liability: $50,000 each person, $100,000 each accident
- Property damage liability: $30,000 each accident
- Rental: $50 each day, $1,500 each accident
- Personal injury protection: $5,000 each person
- Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $30,000 each person, $60,000 each accident
- Uninsured motorist property damage: $25,000 each accident
- Comprehensive: Limit of actual cash value, $1,000 deductible
- Collision: Limit of actual cash value, $1,000 deductible

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per event - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. If $100,000 liability coverage isn't enough to cover a serious accident, please increase your total coverage. 

## Used or new?
Your policy includes Comprehensive and Collision coverages, which pay for the actual cash value of your vehicle in case of a covered loss, minus your deductible. The actual cash value is the market value of your vehicle considering factors such as age, mileage, and condition at the time of the loss.
