Congratulations! You got yourself a Pet Liability Insurance Policy for your 8 weeks old female Golden Retriever puppy, Bella, at 1523 S Ocean Dr, Hallandale Beach, FL 33009. Your policy number is **PTL02896**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **your Golden Retriever puppy, Bella**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after October 1, 2021, and before November 1, 2021.

## Against what?
We protect you against any injuries or damages caused by Bella. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily Injury: $7,000.00
- Property: $7,000.00

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. For example, if Bella caused property damage of $8,000, would your coverage limits be enough?

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy provides replacement cost coverage. That means if Bella causes damage or injury, we would cover the costs without deducting for depreciation, up to your coverage limits.
