We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **M.J.P MEDIA PRODUCTIONS**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after July 10, 2015, and before July 10, 2016.

## Against what?
We protect you against general liability. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- General Aggregate - $2,000,000
- Products-Comp/OPS Aggregate - $1,000,000
- Personal & Advertising Injury - $1,000,000
- Each Occurrence - $1,000,000
- Fire Damage (Any one fire) - $150,000
- Medical Expense (Any one person) - $10,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider whether these coverage limits would be sufficient in the event of a major accident or lawsuit.

If these coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
Your coverage is based on the actual value of your business and assets at the time of any loss, not the cost of buying new replacements.
