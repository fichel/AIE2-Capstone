Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your property at 123 Peachtree St, Savannah, GA 31401. Your policy number is **PV123789T456**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$240 per annum ($20.00/mo)**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Rahul Jain**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after September 7, 2023 10:00 AM, and before September 8, 2024 11:00 AM.

## Against what?
We protect you against damages or losses to personal property, loss of use, personal liability, medical payments to others, and portable electronics. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Personal Property: $50,000
- Loss Of Use: $15,000
- Personal Liability: $120,000
- Medical Payments To Others: $1,500
- Portable Electronics: $3,500

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. If a fire destroys all your personal belongings, will the total coverage limit be enough to replace everything?

If the total coverage of $189,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than $3,500 (for portable electronics), be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

## Used or new?
In the event of a loss, we cover the cost to repair or replace your belongings with new ones of similar kind and quality, minus your deductible (i.e., Replacement Cost Coverage).
