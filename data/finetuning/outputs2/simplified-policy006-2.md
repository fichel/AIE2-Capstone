Congratulations! You got yourself an Auto Insurance Policy for your 2016 Toyota Highlander at 1205 Silver Bridge Ln, Houston, TX 77089. Your policy number is **GTYKLM**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your various **premiums**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Jennifer Smith and her 2016 Toyota Highlander**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after July 15, 2021 at 9:30pm CDT, and before January 15, 2022 at 12:01am CST.

## Against what?
We protect you against damages and losses due to accidents, bodily injury, property damage, rental costs, personal injury, and uninsured/underinsured motorist incidents. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily injury liability: $40,000 each person, $80,000 each accident
- Property damage liability: $30,000 each accident
- Rental: $60 each day, $1,700 each accident
- Personal injury protection: $6,000 each person
- Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $40,000 each person, $80,000 each accident
- Uninsured motorist property damage: $30,000 each accident, $300 deductible.
- Comprehensive: $1,200 deductible. Limit of actual cash value.
- Collision: $1,200 deductible. Limit of actual cash value.
- Roadside assistance: $120 each incident (up to 3 incidents)

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if your current coverage limits would be enough to cover all potential costs in case of a serious accident.

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
The limit of actual cash value for both comprehensive and collision coverage means that in the event of a total loss, the payout will be the market value of your car at the time of the loss, minus your deductible.
