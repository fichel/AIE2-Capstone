Congratulations! You got yourself an Automobile Insurance Policy for your 2015 Honda CR-V at 227 Park Ave, Stamford, CT 06902-1905. Your policy number is **Policy 2**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$2,035.40 per 6 months**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Carlos Mendoza and his 2015 Honda CR-V**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after 11/24/2023, and before 05/24/2024.

## Against what?
We protect you against damages to your vehicle, injuries to your person, and liability if you injure someone else or damage their property. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

Bodily Injury Liability: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
Property Damage Liability: $50,000 per accident
Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
Comprehensive Deductible: $500
Collision Deductible: $500
Rental Reimbursement: $75 per day

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. For example, if your car is totaled in an accident, will the collision coverage limit be enough to replace it?

If these limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
If your car is damaged beyond repair, we’ll pay you the value of a brand-new car of the same make and model, minus the deductible. If your car can be repaired, we’ll pay the cost of repairs, minus the deductible.
