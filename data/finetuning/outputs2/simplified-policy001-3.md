Congratulations! You got yourself a Comprehensive Insurance Policy for your Condominium at 600 N Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60611. Your policy number is **EI962075**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers the Lake Shore Drive Condominium Association.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after June 1, 2021, and before June 1, 2022.

## Against what?
We protect you against liabilities, damages, and losses. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- General Aggregate: $3,000,000
- Each Occurrence: $1,500,000
- Fire Damage (Any one fire): $400,000
- Med Exp (Any one person): $15,000
- Personal & Adv Injury: $1,500,000
- Products - Comp/Op Agg: $3,000,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy should any of the described policies be cancelled before the expiration date.

If these coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
We cover the full replacement cost of your property, not its depreciated value. That means if a covered loss occurs, we'll pay you the cost to replace your property with new items of similar kind and quality.
