We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$260 per year ($21.67/mo)**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after July 10, 2023 09:30 AM, and before July 12, 2024 10:30 AM.

## Against what?
We protect you against loss or damage to your personal property, loss of use, personal liability, medical payments to others, and loss or damage to portable electronics. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Loss Of Use: $15,000
- Personal Liability: $150,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if these coverage limits would be enough in case of a major incident.

If these limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

We provide replacement cost coverage. This means that if your belongings are stolen or damaged beyond repair, we'll pay you the cost to buy new ones at today's prices.
