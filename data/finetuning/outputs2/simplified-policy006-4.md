Congratulations! You got yourself an Auto Insurance Policy for your 2015 Ford Explorer at 4521 West Bay Blvd Tampa, FL 33611. Your policy number is **XJCVBZJ**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **various premiums per installment**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Jonathan Smith**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after July 15, 2021, and before January 15, 2022.

## Against what?
We protect you against liabilities, accidents and damages to your vehicle. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily injury liability: $40,000 each person, $80,000 each accident
- Property damage liability: $35,000 each accident
- Rental: $75 each day, $2,000 each accident
- Personal injury protection: $7,000 each person
- Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $40,000 each person, $80,000 each accident
- Uninsured motorist property damage: $35,000 each accident, $300 deductible
- Comprehensive: $1,500 deductible. Limit of actual cash value
- Collision: $1,500 deductible. Limit of actual cash value

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if these limits will be enough in case of a major accident.

If these coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
Your coverage includes both comprehensive and collision coverage, which provides for the repair or replacement of your vehicle in the event of a covered loss, up to the actual cash value of the vehicle, subject to your deductibles.
