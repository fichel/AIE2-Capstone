## When?
This policy covers events that started after September 1, 2011, and before September 1, 2012.

## Against what?
We protect you against damages and liabilities related to your business operations. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of your coverage limits:

- General Liability

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy provides coverage based on the value of the liability at the time of the event, not the purchase price. If a covered loss occurs, we'll pay the cost to repair or replace the property or liability, up to the limit of your policy.
