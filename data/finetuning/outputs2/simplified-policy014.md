Congratulations! You got yourself a Commercial General Liability Policy for your video production business at 7561 Skyview Road, Riverside, CA 92509. Your policy number is **605096014**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **C.L.K VIDEO PRODUCTIONS**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after April 13, 2012, and before April 13, 2013.

## Against what?
We protect you against general liability claims. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- General Aggregate - $1,000,000
- Products-Comp/OPS Aggregate - $500,000
- Personal & Advertising Injury - $500,000
- Each Occurrence - $500,000
- Fire Damage (Any one fire) - $75,000
- Medical Expense (Any one person) - $5,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. Think about potential accidents or damages that could occur during your video productions.

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
In case of a loss, we will pay the replacement cost of the item lost, which is the cost to replace the item with a new one of similar quality and type, without any deduction for depreciation.
