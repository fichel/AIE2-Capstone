We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **₹4,000.07 premium per year**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **MR. AKASH VERMA and any person including the insured provided that a person driving holds an effective driving license at the time of the accident and is not disqualified from holding or obtaining such a license.**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after 00:00 Hrs on 07/08/2013, and before 23:59 Hrs on 06/08/2014.

## Against what?
We protect you against any damages or accidents to your insured vehicle. There are important limitations, though, such as use for organized racing, speed testing, carriage of goods other than samples or personal luggage, and any purpose in connection with Motor Trade, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Death of or bodily injury to any person: As necessary to meet the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988.
- Damage to property other than property belonging to the insured or held in trust or in the custody of control of the insured: Up to ₹7.5 lakhs

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if these limits will be enough in case of a major accident. 

If ₹7.5 lakhs isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

This policy covers your used Chevrolet Spark LX, manufactured in 2011. The IDV (Insured's Declared Value) of the car is ₹245,485.00, which will be the maximum claimable amount in case of a total loss.
