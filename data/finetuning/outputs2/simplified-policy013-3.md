Congratulations! You got yourself a Renters Policy for your property at 1234 Peachtree St, Savannah, GA 31401. Your policy number is **KG120589G678**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$235 per year** (or $19.58 per month), so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, add valuable items, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Christopher Walker**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after August 22, 2023, and before August 24, 2024.

## Against what?
We protect you against losses or damages to your personal property, loss of use, personal liability, medical payments to others, and portable electronics. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Personal Property: $35,000
- Loss Of Use: $15,000
- Personal Liability: $120,000
- Medical Payments To Others: $1,500
- Portable Electronics: $2,500
- Deductible: $300

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. Think about how much you'd need to replace everything you own if it were all lost. 

If $35,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. And if you own any valuable items worth more than the limits listed above, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

## Used or new?
We provide replacement cost coverage for your belongings. This means we'll pay the cost to replace lost, damaged, or stolen property with new items of like kind and quality, up to the limits of your policy.
