Congratulations! You got yourself a General Liability Policy for your media production company, P.R.S Media Productions, at 8921 Sunset Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90069. Your policy number is **705297023**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **P.R.S Media Productions**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after June 20, 2015, and before June 20, 2016.

## Against what?
We protect you against general liabilities, commercial general liabilities and incidental contractual liabilities. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- General Aggregate - $2,000,000
- Products-Comp/OPS Aggregate - $700,000
- Personal & Advertising Injury - $700,000
- Each Occurrence - $700,000
- Fire Damage (Any one fire) - $100,000
- Medical Expense (Any one person) - $10,000

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if the maximum coverage for each occurrence or aggregate limit would be enough to cover a major incident at your production house.

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy does not detail whether the coverage extends to replacement cost or actual cash value. For more information, please contact your agent, John Miller.
