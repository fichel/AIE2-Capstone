Congratulations! You got yourself a Commercial General Liability and Automobile Liability Insurance Policy for your company, BT Shipping LLC, located at 1320 S Auburn St Ste 730, Colfax CA 95713. Your policy number is **HTUL000682-02**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your premium, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers BT Shipping LLC.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after May 12, 2022, and before May 12, 2023.

## Against what?
We protect you against various liabilities, including general, automobile, and professional E&O related liabilities. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to certain limits. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Each occurrence: $1,500,000
- Damage to rented premises (Each occurrence): $150,000
- Medical expenses (Any one person): $7,500
- Personal and advertising injury: $1,500,000
- General aggregate: $3,000,000
- Contingent Motor Cargo: $300,000 (Deductible: $3,000)
- Professional E&O: $150,000 (Deductible: $3,000)

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. Consider a scenario where multiple liabilities occur in the same year, would the coverage be adequate?

If your coverage limits aren't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
This policy provides coverage for the actual cash value of the insured items. The actual cash value takes into account depreciation, meaning you would be paid the value of the item at the time of loss, not the cost to replace it new.
