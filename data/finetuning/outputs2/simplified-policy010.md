Congratulations! You got yourself an Automobile Insurance Policy for your 2012 Jeep Compass 4D 4Wd Latitude at 565 Winchester Ave, New Haven, CT 06511-1921. Your policy number is **50906667**.

We want to make sure you know what you're getting for your **$1,775.30 per 6 months**, so we did our best to make this policy short and sweet.

Please take a few minutes to read through, and let us know if you have any questions. You can always change coverages, and more.

## Who's covered?
This policy covers **Anakaren Zempoalteca**.

## When?
This policy covers events that started after October 19, 2023.

## Against what?
We protect you against bodily injury liability, property damage liability, uninsured/underinsured motorist incidents, damage requiring a comprehensive or collision deductible, and loss of use requiring rental reimbursement. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

## For how much?
We provide coverage up to a certain limit. Here is a quick overview of the limits you chose (and can change):

- Bodily Injury Liability: $25,000/$50,000
- Property Damage Liability: $25,000
- Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist: $25,000/$50,000
- Comprehensive Deductible: $1,000
- Collision Deductible: $1,000
- Rental Reimbursement: $50 per day

These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

So take a minute to check your policy. Consider a hypothetical accident where you are found at fault, resulting in multiple injuries and significant property damage. If $50,000 isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage.

## Used or new?
Your policy provides coverage for your used 2012 Jeep Compass. In the event of a covered loss, we will pay the actual cash value of your vehicle, which is the replacement cost minus depreciation.
