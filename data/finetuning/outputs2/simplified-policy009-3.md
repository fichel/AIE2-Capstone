## Against what?
We protect you against claims made regarding general liability and employment practices. There are important limitations, though, so please read on.

So take a minute to check your policy and consider if these limits adequately cover potential legal and medical expenses.

If the total coverage limit isn't enough to cover everything, please increase your total coverage. If you own any valuable items worth more than the per-item limit, be sure to add them to your policy so they're covered for their full amount.

## Used or new?
This policy provides coverage for your business operations, so the concept of used or new does not apply.
