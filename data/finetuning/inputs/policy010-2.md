# Farmers Value Insurance Package

# Preliminary Estimate

# Coverage Choices

Below are some general descriptions of insurance coverage. You should consult your policy for terms, conditions and limits of your own insurance coverage or the coverage being offered.

# Home Insurance

Dwelling: Farmers Homeowners insurance gives you options so you can choose the coverage you want. Your house is covered for many types and causes of loss, subject to common exclusions including, but not limited to, wear and tear, earth movement, earthquake, mold, flood and nuclear hazard.

Personal Property: Homeowners insurance covers many household contents and personal belongings. You may think your furniture, clothing, TV, DVD and PC aren't worth a lot but the value of those items adds up fast.

Separate Structures: Separate structures on your property (such as detached garage or tool shed) other than those used for business purposes are covered up to 10% of the coverage limit on your house. Higher limits are available for additional premium.

Loss of Use: If you can't live in your house after a covered loss, we reimburse you for many of the increased costs of living in hotels, meals, etc., up to the applicable limit of insurance and for up to the time period specified.

Personal Liability: Pays when you’re legally liable for someone else’s bodily injury or property damage resulting from an accident or negligent acts by you or household members - on or off premises. This also includes the acts of your pets.

Guest Medical: Pays medical costs, up to the limit selected by you, for guests who are injured at your residence, regardless of your legal liability.

# Automobile Insurance

BIPD (Liability): One of the most important coverages in your auto policy is bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. This coverage compensates individuals who claim that they were injured or suffered property damage because of the ownership, maintenance, or use of your insured auto, up to a limit that you select.

Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist: This coverage compensates you, members of your household, and your passengers, up to a limit that you select, for bodily injury from an accident with a motorist who has no insurance or is underinsured. Uninsured Motorist protection can also compensate you if you're injured by a hit and run driver or if you're injured as a pedestrian.

Medical: This coverage pays reasonable and necessary medical bills and funeral expenses, up to a limit you select, for you or a passenger injured while riding in your vehicle. Coverage also extends to you or a family member when riding as a passenger in someone else's vehicle or when struck by a vehicle as a pedestrian.

Comprehensive & Collision (material damage): Comprehensive coverage compensates you for damage to your vehicle from fire, theft, falling objects, riots, storms, earthquakes, floods, collision with a bird or animal and other natural occurrences. Collision coverage compensates you for damage to your vehicle that results from a collision with another vehicle or object.

Collision Plus / Loss of Use: This coverage is designed to assist you with expenses you may incur in excess of the deductible resulting from a Collision and/or Comprehensive loss.

Towing and Roadside Service: When you or your loved ones are stranded because your car will not operate and you need help, our dispatch service will send the nearest professional to you - 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. And with the sign-and-drive feature in many of our coverages, you may not need a credit card or check to get the help you need.

# Umbrella Insurance

This coverage provides you with higher limits, selected by you, for the types of liability coverages you already have. The Umbrella policy also provides coverage under certain circumstances for liability not covered by underlying insurance.

# Life Insurance

Life insurance can help you plan for needs such as replacement of lost income, a mortgage, education funding, or more. Life insurance may be one of the greatest gifts you can give to those you love. Consider your specific situation to help decide the coverage you want. Your Farmers agent can help provide you with options so you can select the coverage that best fits your situation.
