# Coverage

Unless otherwise endorsed, this policy provides replacement cost coverage on described property and common areas detailed within the Association bylaws including the following types of property within a unit, regardless of ownership:

2. Appliances such as those used for refrigerating, ventilating, cooking, dishwashing, laundering, security or housekeeping.

Replacement cost coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy and any endorsements.

Coverage under this policy may have been modified to provide actual cash value coverage rather than replacement cost coverage, or to remove specified property from coverage, if any endorsement containing in its title “ACV” or “Actual Cash Value,” or “Additional Property Not Covered” is identified on this Certificate of Insurance.

This policy provides coverage on a standalone/individual condominium association.

# Commercial General Liability

State Farm refers to this coverage as Business Liability Coverage. Coverage amount shown is Per Occurrence.

# Loss of Rents, Loss of Income and Extra Expense

If this coverage is shown, limits are “Actual Loss Sustained”. Contact the agent to confirm the number of day's coverage.
